CleanTech: Transforming Waste Management with Transfer Learning
1. Introduction
CleanTech is an AI-driven waste classification system developed to modernize and streamline municipal and industrial waste management. This project applies transfer learning techniques, specifically leveraging the VGG16 deep learning model, to classify waste images into three critical categories: Biodegradable, Recyclable, and Trash. By integrating machine learning with real-time computer vision, CleanTech promotes sustainability, operational efficiency, and environmental compliance.

2. Problem Statement
Traditional waste segregation methods are manual, error-prone, and labor-intensive, leading to inefficiencies in recycling centers, improper disposal in public waste bins, and challenges in industrial waste compliance. There is a need for an intelligent, automated system that ensures accurate and fast classification of waste materials.
